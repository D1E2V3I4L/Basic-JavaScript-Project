# Basic-JavaScript-Project

To-Do List with Priority Feature
This project is a simple and interactive to-do list web application that allows users to add, edit, prioritize, and delete tasks. It also includes functionality to save tasks in the browser's local storage so that the task list persists even after the page is reloaded.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the list.
Edit Tasks: Users can edit existing tasks.
Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list.
Priority Tasks: Users can mark tasks as high priority, which adds a star (★) icon in front of the task.
Task Completion: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking on them, which toggles a strikethrough effect.
Persistent Storage: The task list is saved in local storage, so it persists across browser sessions.
Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the web page.
CSS: For styling the application and adding animations.
JavaScript: For handling the application logic, including adding, editing, prioritizing, and deleting tasks, as well as interacting with local storage.
